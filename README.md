## React Portfolio

Hi and thank you for visiting my portfolio's git page. This project was entirely developed using React.js and the new Hooks technology which heavily uses {useState}.

## Animation Challenge
I know React is a state based framework, but I wanted to have animations in my portfolio to do the page transitions. So I learned how the {useState} works and from there I found an npm package called react-spring. This is an animation package that allows me to set transitions based on state.

## Result
React offers such a smooth and robust experience to develop in by allowing users to swiftly develop their front-ends. JSX has been very powerful and efficient and with the introduction of Hooks I have been able to simply write Javascript alongside the 'HTML' portion so I can develop and test in a short amount of time.

I hope you enjoy my portfolio and if you have any questions feel free to email me at ahumphries102@gmail.com
